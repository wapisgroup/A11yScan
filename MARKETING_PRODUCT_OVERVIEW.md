# Ablelytics Marketing Product Overview

## Summary
Ablelytics is an end-to-end website accessibility platform that helps teams discover, fix, and report WCAG issues at scale. It combines automated crawling, real-browser testing with Axe-core, and professional reporting so compliance, agencies, and developers can move faster with confidence.

## The Problem
- Most organizations have large, fast-changing websites and no efficient way to test them continuously.
- Manual accessibility audits are slow, expensive, and hard to repeat.
- Compliance teams need clear, defensible reporting; developers need actionable fixes.

## The Solution
Ablelytics automates accessibility audits across entire websites and delivers clear results, progress tracking, and polished reports. Teams can prioritize issues, measure improvements, and prove compliance over time.

## How It Works (High Level)
1. Connect a project and start a crawl or upload a sitemap.
2. Run scans across selected pages or full sites.
3. Review issues with context (selectors, severity, WCAG references).
4. Generate branded reports for stakeholders.
5. Monitor progress over time.
