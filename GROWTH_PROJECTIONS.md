## Most Likely Scenario: Moderate

**Why Moderate is Most Realistic:**

✅ **Pros:**
- Accessibility is legally mandated (ADA, WCAG)
- Growing market with increasing awareness
- Clear pain point: manual testing is expensive ($5K-50K per audit)
- Your tool solves real problem at attractive price
- Mid-market gap (competitors are too expensive or too limited)
- Recurring revenue model
- High margins (60-92%)

⚠️ **Challenges:**
- 2-3 month sales cycle for B2B
- Education required (many don't know they need it)
- Competition from free tools (Lighthouse, Wave)
- Enterprise sales need customization
- Must prove ROI vs manual audits
- Churn risk if only used for one-time audit

**Expected Path:**
- **Months 1-3:** Build initial user base, free tier → paid conversions
- **Months 4-6:** Find product-market fit, first enterprise customers
- **Months 7-12:** Scale marketing, 20-30% MoM growth
- **Year 2:** Expand features, target enterprise, potentially raise funding

**Year 1 Realistic Outcome: $12K-25K MRR ($144K-300K ARR)**

## What Could Go Wrong 🔴

1. **Too few free → paid conversions (<2%)**
   - Solution: Improve onboarding, prove value faster, time-limit free tier

2. **High churn (>8%/month)**
   - Solution: Monthly scheduled scans, better engagement, annual plans

3. **Sales cycle too long (>6 months)**
   - Solution: Target smaller companies, self-serve signup, free trial

4. **Can't acquire customers profitably (CAC > LTV)**
   - Solution: Focus on organic growth, content marketing, reduce paid ads

5. **Free tools are "good enough"**
   - Solution: Emphasize full-site scanning, reports, automation, ongoing monitoring

6. **Enterprise wants on-premise**
   - Solution: Cloud-only until $50K+ MRR, then consider

7. **Legal/compliance issues**
   - Solution: Clear disclaimers, partner with accessibility lawyers, insurance

---

## What Could Go Better 🟢

1. **Viral organic growth** (accessibility advocacy community shares tool)
2. **Partnership with major CMS** (Webflow, WordPress plugin)
3. **Government contracts** (require WCAG compliance)
4. **Acquisition interest** (competitors or larger platforms)
5. **Celebrity/influencer endorsement** (accessibility advocate)
6. **Legal requirement changes** (stricter ADA enforcement)
7. **Competitor fails** (you absorb their customers)

---

## Bottom Line: Is This Worth It?

### ✅ YES, if you:
- Can handle 3-6 months with little/no revenue
- Enjoy technical challenges (crawling, browser automation)
- Believe in accessibility mission
- Are comfortable with B2B sales
- Have $5-10K runway or can keep day job
- Want to build sustainable, profitable business

### 🤔 MAYBE, if you:

### ❌ NO, if you:
- Need immediate income
- Can't commit 20+ hours/week

- $80K-150K profit
- Sustainable full-time business

---

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Conservative approach, execute as Moderate:**
1. Keep costs low (Cloud Run Jobs, minimal marketing)
2. Focus on product quality & user experience
3. Invest time in content marketing (free, compounds over time)
4. Target mid-market agencies ($299/month sweet spot)
5. Convert free users aggressively (they're qualified leads)
6. Build for annual plans (better retention)

**Realistic Year 1 Goal: $15K MRR ($180K ARR), $120K profit**

This is achievable, sustainable, and sets you up for much larger growth in Year 2+.

**Your market is growing 25% annually. Even capturing 0.01% is a multi-million dollar business.**
